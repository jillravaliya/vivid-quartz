I'm an aspiring DevOps Engineer with practical experience in designing, containerizing, and deploying real-world applications. My projects demonstrate end-to-end DevOps workflow automation using Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes, with successful live deployment on Render Cloud.

Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in my final year at Gujarat Technological University, I focus on Cloud, DevOps, and Automation through self-driven projects and practical implementation. I continuously explore tools and practices that enhance collaboration between development and operations.

Passionate about building scalable, automated, and reliable systems. I believe in learning by doing and have hands-on experience with containerization, orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployments.
